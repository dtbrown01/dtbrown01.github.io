Melbourne, often hailed as Australia's cultural and culinary capital, but also its actual capital from 1901 to 1927, and now Australia’s biggest city (by around 18,000 people). One of its most iconic, and globally significant, features is its extensive tram network. The trams are more than just a pleasant mode of public transport, they are also a key part of the city’s identity.

The story of Melbourne's trams dates back to the late 19th century, making it one of the oldest tram networks in the world. The first horse-drawn tram started operating in 1884, with electric trams following in 1889. However, tram networks, or at the very least street cars, where not an abnormality at that time with most medium-large cities having them, particularly in Western Countries. This changed globally following the automobile, and the subsequent redesign of streets, most evident in the US but also in Sydney and Brisbane. This redevelopment often removed street cars and trams, however not in Melbourne.

Today, the Melbourne tram network boasts over 250 kilometres of double tracks, intersecting throughout the city. When combined with Melbourne’s, far from perfect but large, suburban rail network the city has some of Australia’s best public transport.

Melbourne's tram system is renowned for its efficiency and coverage. Whether you're a local or a visitor, trams are a convenient way to get around the city. They're an integral part of Melbourne's public transportation system, providing accessibility to major attractions, shopping districts, and entertainment hubs. The distinctive green and yellow trams are a common sight on Melbourne's streets, making it convenient to explore various parts of the city.

The inner city, City Circle Free Zone, is a free and convenient way for visitors to explore the CBD, and provides easy access, or sightseeing, to landmarks such as the Flinders Street Station, State Library, multiple theatres and museums and various shopping precincts. 

Melbourne's trams go beyond transportation; they are an essential part of the city's cultural identity. The annual Melbourne International Film Festival even features a curated films played on specific trams, whilst there was also the iconic Colonial Tramcar Restaurant until 2018.

Of course, the extensive tram network isn’t just great for tourism, it provides a great mode of transport for both commuting and leisure activities. They are also a part of the city’s future sustainability plans, with trams providing an eco-friendly mode of transport, contributing to reduced carbon emissions in the city. Melbourne is also modernising to ensure the tram network remains efficient. 

Melbourne trams are not just a mode of transportation but an integral part of the city's  identity. They offer convenience, accessibility, and a unique way to explore the city while contributing to a more sustainable urban future.

In the realm of modern transportation, the concept of active travel has emerged as a compelling force, reshaping how we move and view mobility. At its core, active travel is characterised by  'human-powered mobility,' including activities such as walking and cycling. With a broader category including electric scooters and e-bikes, referred to as micro-mobility.

Active travel stands out amidst various travel modes, such as cars and public transport, due its distinctive benefits, on communities and individuals. One especially unique benefit is that active travel requires physical effort, providing exercise within the daily happenings of life, offering numerous associated health benefits. 

Micro mobility is also far more inclusive than other modes of mobility, especially private motor vehicles, allowing for travel from those who are too young or old to drive, or who have medical conditions or cost pressures limiting their ability to access of drive motor vehicles. Active travel and micro mobility is also very cost and space effective, having both a minimal indivudal cost and infrastructure cost as opposed to other transport.

As more people begin utilising micro mobility and the subsequent shift from the car-centric form of current transport there can also be noticeable reductions in emissions and congestion, improving the liveability for all members of the community.

Active travel, considers all trip purposes, except for competition-related activities. A distinction is drawn between transport and non-transport trip purposes, with non-transport trips primarily being for recreation and exercise and transport trips being commutes or other travel between places.

However, one of the greatest challenges is infrastructure, with micro mobility currently leaving those utilising infrastructure vulnerable, especially to vehicle traffic. This can be improved by better travel networks. This includes quality infrastructure which is accessible, well connected and well integrated including through signage and lighting. There should also be infrastructure for direct trips, including "bike highways" and end-of-trip facilities including showers, lockers and bike parking. There should also be appropriate planning for shared travel infrzastructure, as shown below:

As we traverse the landscape of active travel, it becomes evident that this paradigm shift extends beyond mere mobility. It encompasses health, sustainability, and community well-being, urging us to rethink and reshape our approach to transportation for more vibrant and healthier communities.

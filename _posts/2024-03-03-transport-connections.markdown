Links between different modes of transport are often the least considered in the development of transport infrastructure, but often have the highest impact on the way in which transport is used, and which mode is preferred.

Public transport often falls short due to the lack of connection, whether that is connection to places people want to go, or connections with other forms of transportation. Without easy and comfortable connections between modes of transport ultimately bringing people within a comfortable walking distance to their destination within a reasonable period, cars and private methods of transportation will be the preferred method, regardless of how appropriate that really is. 

One of the more important connections, that is often overlooked due to higher costs and greater complexity, is connections to intercity transportation. Of course, the preferred intercity transport method for long-term costs and sustainability is rail, however this can also include buses and air travel. Now, most major cities have reliable connections to their major intercity transport hubs, with intercity rail travelling to major stations, and dedicated rail connections to airports, with intercity buses having greater flexibility to be located near public transport. However, even major cities have notable exceptions including the lack of a rail connection to Melbourne airport.  

Smaller cities often are significantly lacking in terms of intercity connections to their local public transportation. An example of this is Canberra, which has begun developing a light rail network, however it is not planned to have any connection to the airport or the train station for decades, with the existing connections between the airport being served by regular buses, however the train station is serviced by unreliable and irregular bus services, partially due to the substandard nature of the train connection to Canberra. Developing transport hubs at these intercity locations, allows both the local and intercity transport networks to be improved, incentivising different methods of transport as opposed to car travel. There is especially demand for this in locations such as airports and train stations, where car parking can be incredibly expensive, or non-existent, due to the extended periods cars need to be parked. 

As well as intercity connections, connections between different methods of both micro and public transportation can improve the use of car alternatives. Cost effective connection options include proper bike and pedestrian connectivity to stops and stations, including secure and effective bike parking options, or the ability to take bikes on public transport (which is far less scalable). Another example, often seen in Europe, is cross-platform transfers, allowing for transfers between the same method, such as heavy rail routes, or between different modes, typically between heavy rail (suburban rail) and light rail or trams within urban centres. This has the capacity to improve the way in which routes and connections are understood, alleviating some anxiety that are felt by people when travelling on public transport, especially if they do not do it regularly.  

Ultimately transport connections, and inter-modal transport hubs form the backbone of effective public transport, allowing for different methods of transport to serve different purposes, improving the overall efficiency of the system. Well planned connections also help to improve the comfort and convenience for users of public transport, increasing the likelihood that people would prefer public transport over private vehicles.

Apple’s announcement of the Vision Pro surprised no-one, given the wild speculation surrounding the announcement, as well as the advancements in the real of virtual reality, the *“Metaverse”. This technology has been overhyped, and typically under polished. What does Apple getting involved mean?*

Well, really not much. Apple announcing their own Augmented Reality Headset may revive hype surrounding this type of technology, proper use-cases and price constraints haven’t vanished. The price point is especially constraining, with the Vision Pro being priced at $5000 (AUD). 

However, the Augmented Reality and especially Virtual Reality headsets have profound impacts on human interaction, and not in the sense that you can meet people in the physical world, but that you restrict communication with those actually around you. And a screen recording your eyes is just weird, and not the solution. *Right?*

Sure there are benefits to AR in public spaces, especially in education and entertainment, allowing overlays over existing spaces, visualising different concepts. But they are likely to completely redefine these spaces if successful, potentially preventing those unable to afford new technology from participating in public spaces. The prohibitive cost of this technology will only further divide people based on socio-economic status, if the technology become widespread. It will also give corporations unprecedented access to everyone's data, I’m not sure if I want that. 

AR and VR will also completely redefine the approach to workspaces, with there being less need for offices, down town areas will have a large decrease in economic activity if proper planning and thought is taken, this will also likely further decrease the physical social interaction that people already have, adversely impacting mental heath. 

AR and VR have the capacity to enrich our lives, enhance our environments, and foster a more connected society, however it is unlikely that this will occur. The high polish and the wonderful user experience reported from the Apple Vision Pro, means that this technology may be becoming more widespread, and its current consequences will only be exacerbated, widening inequalities and furthering feelings of isolation, despite the increasingly connected world.

In the world of technology a large shift is underway, towards decentralised solutions. These solutions don't rely on the Googles and Facebooks of the current technology sector, instead relying on open communication standards, in which multiple individuals can form the technology and the solution.

Decentralised technologies, are typically, open source and rely on maintenance and support from the community. These technologies are also hosted separately, by contributors and community members, and often rely on communication between different smaller hosted versions, similar to Peer-to-Peer technologies.

Some occurrences of current decentralised technologies include cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies. However, these in themselves are not the most practical utilisations of decentralised technology. Cryptocurrencies are currently flawed, in the sense that they are treated as an investment, rather than as a currency as they were originally designed for. Subsequently, given their current limited practical use, yet still holding monetary value, and the lacking general understanding, cryptocurrencies have become a centre for scams.

The current most promising technologies are different software systems, primarily social media, which utilise the ActivityPub standard, such as Mastodon, FireFish (both Twitter alternatives) and Pixelfed (an Instagram alternative). These systems can all function interchangeably, and can be hosted by many separate “instances”. This is promising, as it removes challenges associated with centralised moderation, and the privacy issues that revolve around only major companies controlling user data.

Some major problems that arise with decentralised systems are scalability, hindering their ability to handle large numbers of users, and the way that some scale almost defeats the purpose, relying on only a few centralised instances. The user experience is another major hindrance to mass adoption, as applications can be less intuitive and far less appealing than centralised counterparts. This is especially due to the expectation that users are tech-savvy. 

In relation to blockchain networks other problems also arise. These include regulatory uncertainty, and environmental impacts. The power consumption of blockchain networks is incredibly high, particularly proof of work based systems, like Bitcoin.

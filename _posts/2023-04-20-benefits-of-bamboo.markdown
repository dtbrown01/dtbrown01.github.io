Privacy is an important aspect of our lives especially in urban and suburban settings. Bamboo can be seen as an effective, and good looking, evergreen which can act as a screen along boundaries or even on balconies. Bamboo, specifically clumping varieties, is an effective living screen because it grows quickly, unlike most hedges, is evergreen and is dense, it can also be managed relatively easy making it low maintenance when compared to some hedging varieties. 

However, despite spreading bamboo sharing some of these properties (especially growing quickly), it can be far more work and have a considerable impact on surrounding plants, this is because (as is in its name) it spreads easily. This also means that spreading bamboo is classified as an invasive species in some areas. Due to this classification though, it is unlikely that you will find spreading bamboo in a garden centre.

## Local Benefits of Bamboo

Bamboo when properly maintained in urban centres can also provide valuable greenery, which improves both mental heath and also increases the ability of urban centres to adapt to climate change, through limiting the heat island effect. 

Greenery in urban centres has been credited with improving mental health, through promoting physical activity, greater stress recovery and strengthening social connections.

Greenery also has a profound impact on the heat island effect found in urban and suburban areas as it can help absorb some of the heat that is being absorbed and reflected within the man-made environment - especially due to the dark colour of roads and some roofs.


## Wider Benefits of Bamboo

Due to the fast growing nature of bamboo it is a sustainable source for building materials, with a large number of people already living in buildings made from bamboo. Bamboo is used commonly as a building material in many developing nations due to its low cost and versatility, with it being a common component of scaffolding. Bamboo's organic nature also means that it is less harmful to the environment when compared to most materials used for single use packaging, with bamboo now being used in disposable cutlery and take-away containers. 

The fast growing nature of bamboo also makes it an effective carbon sink, similar to sea-weeds, because it can store carbon before being cut and utilised for other purposes (that do not involve burning it), and the plant can continue to grow. Spreading varieties can also be used for this purpose, so long as boundaries of the plantation are controlled. It should also be noted that despite the benefits of large bamboo plantations they should not be created at the expense of the deforestation of other trees, as bamboo is a grass and thus stores less carbon than these trees, the trees are also far more important to biodiversity and take a considerably longer period to mature, from decades to centuries compared with the five to ten years of bamboo.

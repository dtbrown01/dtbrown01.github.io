When it comes to furnishing our homes, we often turn to popular suppliers like Ikea for their affordable and convenient options. However, there's an alternative that brings a unique touch to your living space while offering numerous benefits: home-made furniture. Creating your own furniture allows you to unleash your creativity, achieve a personalised look, and even contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Despite these benefits is it worth the effort?

We created our own small cabinet, purely because there were no affordable solutions that had our desired dimensions, especially depth, as well as ensured practicality. One of the most exciting aspects of home made furniture is the opportunity to unleash your creativity, however I personally lack much creativity so ours is quite boring. 

Our cabinet had three main criteria, to fit in a small area between a doorway and the TV cabinet, a place to charge devices, and, to store the router out of sight. We decided on a small shelf for charging, an open shelf, a cupboard and a large cupboard at the bottom.

Unlike mass-produced furniture, which tends to have a one-size-fits-all approach, home-made furniture offers customisation options that cater specifically to your needs. You can adjust the dimensions, modify features, and incorporate additional functionalities to ensure your furniture fits perfectly in your space. Additionally, you can personalise your home-made creations by adding special touches such as engravings, carvings, or even upholstery that reflect your personality and create a truly unique piece.

In an era where sustainability is gaining increasing importance, home-made furniture shines as a greener alternative. When you create your own furniture, you have the power to choose ethically sourced materials, reduce waste, and ensure the long-lifespan of the furniture. You can repurpose salvaged wood, up cycle old furniture, or use sustainable materials like bamboo or reclaimed materials. It is also important to note the poor quality of materials utilised by cheap furniture retailers also has long-term impacts due to their short lifespan, and subsequently considerably higher waste.

While it's true that mass-produced furniture is often more affordable, home-made furniture can be a cost-effective choice in the long run. By utilising materials sourced directly from suppliers or repurposing items you already own, you can significantly reduce costs. Additionally, with the right tools and skills, you can save money on labour costs, making it possible to create high-quality furniture at a fraction of the price of store-bought equivalents. And lets be honest putting together IKEA furniture is not all that easy in itself, so for a similar price and a little more work you can get a more personal final product which will likely last longer.

Home-made furniture gives a range of benefits that go beyond mere functionality. It provides an avenue for creative expression, customisation, and personalisation, allowing you to bring your vision to life and create furniture that perfectly suits your home. Home-made furniture can help you to embrace a more sustainable lifestyle, both environmentally and for your own wallet. So why settle for generic pieces when you can have unique, customised furniture that tells your story? The pain and extra effort is a reasonable answer of course.

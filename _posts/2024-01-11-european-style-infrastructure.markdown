We often see it, particularly in cities that are not very well designed, a description of new infrastructure aimed at improving streetscapes for uses other than driving, well the media calls them “European Style”, and not always as a compliment.

Well, are they even “European Style”, it depends, sometimes they might be similar to Dutch protected intersections and cycling infrastructure, often a compromise between a typical car-oriented intersection and the Dutch method. “European Style” isn’t even a very good description, Europe is large and has a wide variety of different infrastructure, is infrastructure in Spain the same as in Sweden, probably similar, but neither are really what the media is describing. 

Then why is more pedestrian and cyclist friendly infrastructure labelled as “European Style”, because it is easy for writers, and it provides a very basic understanding. However, it can also be used to try and make a statement, that our location can’t support that type of infrastructure because we aren’t in Europe and thus, the local government is trying to supress the freedom of cars and push a different agenda. Sure, it sounds a little extreme, but is it really? You just need to look in the comments of some of these posts (I do not recommend doing that).

So with these very vague descriptions, and obvious public sentiment, are these more people friendly intersections out of place in car dependent areas? Well, yes technically, but in a good way, this type of infrastructure can make it easier to traverse urban areas in anything other than a car. This means that there is less chance of collisions and subsequently injury, whilst also decreasing the amount of car traffic in these areas, in turn making it easier to drive, despite the mild inconvenience of the new intersections.

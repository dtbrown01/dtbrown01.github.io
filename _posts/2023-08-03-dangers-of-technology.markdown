Technology has increasingly become a part of our lives (I say this but don't remember a time personally where it wasn't), with algorithms controlling more and more of the content that we view and experience.

Algorithms are everywhere, from selecting what we will listen to, watch, and just mindlessly scroll through, but the truth is they are almost never in our best interests. Whilst we should be glad, that most algorithms primarily aim to maximise our engagement (in itself a worrying trend), with that system in itself creating problems, especially relating to comparisons, and other content that can impact our mental well-being. This is especially evident in apps such as Instagram, and has been measured to have detrimental impact on mental health, especially that of teenagers.

Social media algorithms are designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. The longer we stay on the platform, the more ads we see, and the more revenue the company generates. However, this quest for user engagement has led algorithms to prioritise sensational content, divisive opinions, and emotionally charged posts. As a result, users often find themselves in echo chambers, exposed only to information that reinforces their existing beliefs, limiting their exposure to diverse perspectives.

One of the most significant issues with social media algorithms are these echo chambers. These echo chambers are virtual cocoons where users are isolated from views and opinions that differ from their own. This can breakdown constructive dialogue between different ideological groups, and also hinders empathy and critical thinking. This is especially evident by political beliefs, especially in the United States. 

The amount of data collected and stored from algorithms, and our use of social media, is also alarming. Corporate ownership of these platforms means that vast amounts of personal data are collected, analysed, and monetised. This raises serious concerns about data privacy and potential manipulation of users. We've witnessed instances where personal data has been misused, leading to real-world consequences such as the spread of misinformation or the manipulation of political opinions. This can be seen by both recent allegations surrounding TikTok as well as the Cambridge Analytica Scandal, that arose from the misuse of Facebook's user data during the 2016 US election.

Social media platforms, also employ psychological tactics to make their apps addictive. Features like infinite scrolling and personalised notifications are designed to keep us hooked, often leading to excessive screen time and negative impacts on mental health. Studies have linked excessive social media use to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. The focus of social media on engaging content, especially emocional charged posts, can especially impact peoples mental heath, let alone the ease of cyber bullying through these platforms.

While social media algorithms have undoubtedly enhanced our online experiences in many ways, their negative effects cannot be overlooked. The corporate ownership of these algorithms raises significant concerns about data privacy, manipulation, and the erosion of public discourse

Electric Vehicles have taken the automotive world by storm, promising a cleaner, greener future on our roads. While the excitement surrounding EVs is explainable, is it really as justified as we think? Lets delve into the hype of electric vehicles, understanding their trade-offs, and what we should be focusing on instead.

The enthusiasm surrounding electric vehicles has been impossible to ignore. From headlines touting zero emissions to celebrity endorsements of the latest EV models, it's clear that EVs have captured the collective imagination. However, it's crucial to distinguish between genuine progress and overly optimistic claims.

EVs are often hailed as the ultimate solution to air pollution, with zero tailpipe emissions. While it's true that EVs produce no direct emissions while driving, the overall emissions reduction heavily relies on the source of electricity. If the electricity grid powering EVs is predominantly fueled by non-renewable sources, the environmental benefits might not be as significant. Emissions form production are also often under represented, the raw metals used, particularly cobalt and lithium, for batteries are especially large polluters. This is especially prevalent in less developed countries, where most of these materials are sourced, as environmental regulations are either non-existent, not strict, or not enforced.

Additionally, the disposal of batteries poses an environmental challenge, and if our current E-Waste is any indicator, less developed countries will likely face the worst consequences, despite us, the developed countries, actually being the ones to consume the most EVs and subsequently batteries. We also can't ignore the serious social cost that material extraction and processing in these countries have, given poor working conditions, limited pay and no legislation supporting workers.

The largest draw back to EVs is the fact that they are still cars. Cars have drastically changed our lives, mostly for the better, however we now have better public transport technology, and greater infrastructure that can handle higher population densities. This leaves cars in a weird space, where we need them for our existing suburbs, and thus need to accommodate them in future developments, taking space away from people, and exacerbating wealth inequalities. Highways divide communities and can at worse, act as a reason to prevent the development of better infrastructure, such as public transport and cycling paths. Cars also have serious safety consequences, from collisions with other vehicles and with pedestrians, which will only get worse with EVs, due to their heavy battery packs increasing the weight and size of cars. And no! Self-Driving cars will not save us either. 

Health consequences  from reliance on cars is also often overlooked, we spend our time in cars instead of doing habitual exercise that would result from taking public transport, or god forbid, cycling. Decreasing the number of cars might even incentivise more people to take these active routes, creative a positive cycle. Of course this is limited by urban planning in your city, and the access to public transport. But the sad thing is, we likely need to stop using cars first before the infrastructure changes, as in we need to increase the demand for alternatives first, even if the provision of these alternatives would create the needed demand to support them.

Overall, whilst EVs are an improvement, they prevent the fundamental change we actually need to improve outcomes for everyone, and they still maintain the status-quo that has led us to our current crisis.

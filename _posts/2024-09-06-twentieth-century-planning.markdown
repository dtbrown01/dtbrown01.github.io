We are all well accustomed to the typical measures of traffic and the arguments that we need to keep expanding our freeways and suburban sprawl to meet traffic or housing demand. But all of these measures seem to only worsen the crises whilst making happiness take a nose dive.

Recently I have been reading the book “Happy City” which challenges the car-centric ideals of cities (although most people in the urbanism sphere now know this). In truth car-centric cities seem to have been a compromise of form and function which somehow made both so much worse and ultimately deprived our cities and even smaller towns. 

The early focus on the exurbs, something unfamiliar to me living in a relatively small (although very suburban city), in which commutes can total 6 hours of driving each day questions the motivations of suburban expansion to provide the “American Dream” of family life in a detached home with a large backyard. This is especially questioned by the focus on the less explored and more troubling aspect of the way it actually impacts people, how despite having the theoretical facilities that should make life more liveable, the commutes and lack of social interaction, even among family members, actually work to make life less liveable. 

The focus on behavioural economics is also particularly interesting, highlighting the role advertising has had in leading society so far from the prevailing economic theory that consumers make all decisions in their best interests. The idea of this theory that households knew what is best for them has historically been used as the reasoning for the every expanding suburbs (as well as arguments against government policy against tobacco or sugar). But if moving to the suburbs and isolating ourselves was actually the best choice, why does happiness seem to be going backwards.

The idea of optimising the suburbs for their function for the nuclear family, has actually worsened quality of life for everyone, particularly the children the suburbs were advertised as being beneficial for. The absolute need for a car limits the freedom of children, who are restricted in their use of a car, and also for those of those who are unable or unwilling to own a car.

Now, if living in the suburbs and exurbs is so bad we must live in those towers in the CBD right? Well that is the first assumption made by Charles Montgomery, but supprisinly many of the same challenges are faced by those towers, just on a slightly smaller scale. People are even less likely to interact with neighbours in a hallway than they are in suburban streets, and elevators they might as well be awkward versions of freeways. So the best option must be something in between.

The in-between of medium density housing, with private spaces and shared spaces that are shared between only a few neighbours allow for relationships to be grown and a more welcoming social environment. Additionally, as outlined in the book “Soft City”, as well as numerous other sources, medium density housing provides the best economic potential for cities, maximising tax revenue whilst minimising the construction cost per household, as medium density buildings require far less engineering than apartment towers and suburban houses just don’t produce much tax and don’t have any economies of scale (besides those housing developers that have worsened and encouraged suburban growth).  Medium density housing also allows for residents to have housing that meets their own desires, seclusion a yard etc. whilst still supporting the density that permits well resourced and utilised public transport, witch is actually far more efficient than the mess of freeways and arterial roads that are associated with so many western cities. 

Overall, twentieth century planning moved too far away from the medium-density suburbs that so often supported liveable communities that were connected by street car and train, to a greater focus on individuals in both housing design and transport. Individualism has primarily fuelled the retreat of our social lives and worsened economies of everyone from cities to households, and especially the environment.

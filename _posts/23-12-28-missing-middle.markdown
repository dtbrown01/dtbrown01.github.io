Cities around the world are faced with numerous challenges, from growing populations and the slow transition of societal expectations and desires, often resulting in unsustainable Urban Sprawl. A solution, which still provides the space and community people moving to suburbs expect, whilst also enabling more financially sustainable and liveable cities is medium density housing. This includes town-houses as well as smaller apartment blocks, in which greater unit sizes can be accommodated. This housing is known as middle housing and is often referred to as the “missing middle” in car dependent cities, such as many in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Missing middle is designed to provide a balance between the high density of urban cores, and the low density of single-family detached housing in the suburbs. This kind of housing was historically, the bulk of a city, and can be seen throughout Europe. In North America this kind of housing was often demolished, in order to provide car infrastructure to ensure that suburbs could connect to the urban centre, as a result of the shift in public perception and the rise of “The American Dream” (also present in other Global North countries), which revolves around the desire to own a detached home in a quiet suburb.  

The missing middle housing is particularly important to local governments, due to the prohibitive cost of maintaining urban sprawl, even bankrupting multiple cities within North America. These cost pressures are mitigated, due to the higher density, allowing for less infrastructure to be provided, whilst also resulting in higher tax or rate revenue from the same land area. This is only further improved by well-planned medium density housing, which is best developed in sites (usually brown field) near urban centres and the already existing infrastructure, as well as transit-oriented development, mitigating the requirement for additional car connections to be established. 

Missing middle housing allows for increased population density without sacrificing neighbourhood character. These housing types promote a more diverse and dynamic urban environment by offering a mix of housing options within a given area. Missing middle housing can also provide more affordable housing, due to the smaller (although more often more appropriate) sizes of housing and the greater density reducing the land costs. Additionally, medium density housing is often located further from the high land values of urban centres, in which high density is the only viable option for profitable developments.: 

Concentrating housing in well-designed, moderate-density developments can contribute to more sustainable urban development. By reducing urban sprawl and promoting walkability, missing middle housing encourages the use of public transportation and minimizes the environmental impact of commuting. 

It should also be noted that middle housing can result in gentrification, especially if occurring in otherwise neglected urban borders, in which residents may be pushed out due to the rise in housing costs or feel alienated within their communities. However, with proper planning, and provisions for subsided affordable housing these impacts can be mitigated. 

Additionally, many cities have zoning codes that favour single-family homes in outer suburbs or high-density developments within urban centres (hence making it the missing middle), making it difficult for medium density housing to be integrated, or developed by private developers. Revisiting and updating zoning regulations is crucial for unlocking the potential of these housing types. 

Resistance from existing residents who fear changes to their neighbourhoods, known as NIMBYs (Not in My Backyard) can pose a significant challenge. Effective community engagement and communication are essential to address concerns and build support for missing middle housing projects. This can be especially important, given most NIMBYs support the developments, just do not want it to occur within their neighbourhoods. 

As cities continue to grow and evolve, the concept of middle housing provides a promising solution to the missing provisions of housing affordability challenges of housing affordability, sustainability, and urban development. By fostering more inclusive, liveable neighbourhoods, missing middle housing represents a crucial step towards creating cities that are more liveable and more sustainable, both economically and environmentally.

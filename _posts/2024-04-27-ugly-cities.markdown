Just look at those new suburbs, endless suburban sprawl and identical apartment buildings precariously plopped throughout our cities. Its hard not to wonder why modern buildings are so ugly.

I’m sure the answer is simple, its most likely cost - everything seems to be these days. As always, this cost is almost certainly short term cost, after all why should an already bankrupt developer care about the long term impacts of their cost cutting. Some cost cutting is dangerous, some just demoralising. Some modern houses and apartment buildings seem to be more fragile then a house of cards, and the cards only ever fall when the developer is long gone. Just look at those apartments in Sydney, those houses in Melbourne, Hobart, Canberra, Brisbane and any city in the US. 

But, lets not just consider that truly dangerous and irresponsible cost cutting and poor construction. Lets talk about the ridiculous cookie-cutter monotonous hellscape that are modern cities. Cheap, affordable housing would be amazing, and if that was what this was achieving I certainly wouldn’t be complaining - but its obvious that that isn’t what is being achieved. 

Step into any modern suburb or apartment complex, and you'll likely find a striking lack of diversity in architectural styles. Whether it's identical suburban homes with minor variations in facade colour or generic apartment buildings clad in uninspiring facades, the result is a landscape devoid of visual interest. This homogeneity not only dulls the senses but also erases the unique identity and character of neighbourhoods.

The rise of mass production techniques in construction has led to a proliferation of standardised housing designs and prefab apartment modules. While these methods offer efficiency and cost savings for developers, they come at the expense of architectural creativity and craftsmanship. As a result, we're left with soulless structures that fail to inspire or evoke any emotional connection with their inhabitants. And even worse developers, who benefit from the critical lack of supply of housing, significantly overcharge for these houses (as any capitalist would). This is another reason we need more medium density zoning, supply can be met allowing prices to be deflated and allowing creativity to become more affordable.

This can all be improved if developments no longer adhere to the standardised buildings, embracing local culture and the local environment. This allows for the incorporation of regional materials and buildings better suited to the climatic conditions, overall making buildings more interesting, inviting and sustainable.

Meaningful engagement with local residents is needed, as it always should be, to ensuring that new developments reflect the needs and aspirations of the community. Participatory design processes, and collaborative decision-making platforms need to empower people to shape their built environment and hold developers accountable for delivering spaces that serve the public good.

The time has come to reimagine our urban landscapes and reclaim the soul of our cities from the clutches of homogeneity and profit-driven development. By embracing architectural diversity, fostering design innovation, and empowering communities to shape their built environment, we can create cities that are vibrant, inclusive, and allow for more development that supports residents regardless of their financial situation.

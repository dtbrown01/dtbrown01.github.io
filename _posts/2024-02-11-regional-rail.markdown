Regional rail is common place in some parts of the world, and not so common place in many others. Arguably the two most notable examples of horrendous regional rail are Australia and the United States. These countries share one common geographical feature, they are large with huge distances between population centres. But is this really a disadvantage for rail.

Despite the large distances and low population density of Australia and the United States, there is also another similarity - the expansive yet decaying network of highways. It is arguable even that United States has a better rail system, at least for freight, with a large network, many of which being privatised. 

In Australia, regional rail investment is considerably low, with freight rail expanding, all be it incredibly slower, the most notable expansion is inland rail, running between Melbourne and Brisbane. Similar to the US there is also considerable private rail networks used for transporting raw materials, largely within Western Australia, many of which even remotely or autonomously  controlled. Other freight rail exists purely for raw materials, given they are Australiaâ€™s most important exports, including coal train networks to the port of Newcastle, north of Sydney.

Despite these dedicated networks, intercity freight is almost entirely transported by either trucks or air, both considerably more inefficient and costly than rail, that is if the infrastructure existed. An evident barrier for national train networks is the lack of standardised gauge, with New South Wales and the new national standard being standard gauge, whereas Victoria and South Australia use a wide gauge and the remainder (Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia) using a narrow gauge. 

Arguably, however, the most considerable problem for future rail expansion is the lack of political will, and even public hostility. This is evident in both the United States and Australia, were the current standard of using road networks results in many people being hostile to change and any short-term focused studies often finding greater benefit in upgrading and developing road connections instead of rail connections. This short-term benefit is often a result of modelling suggesting a slow or lack of uptake in rail, even if cost means that it would largely be the best option for businesses and travellers a like. This comparison is even more appropriate given the similar costs associated with a large highway (at least 4 lanes) and rail, with rail even requiring less land for a greater level of efficiency, reducing land acquisition costs, or allowing the easement to be used for other purposes, including a less significant highway.

The expansion of railways within Australia is particularly when the most considerable cost of land acquisition can be removed in many cases where previous rail right of wail remains in place. This existing easement is a key consideration of proposed plans for a rail link between Canberra, and Eden, involving the upgrade of abandoned railway between Canberra and Bombala, and then a new span of rail to Eden, allowing for operations at Eden port to increase, making use of its considerable natural depth, whilst also relieving pressures in other major areas, such as Sydney and Newcastle. The benefit of this plan is further supported through existing connections to western New South Wales, allowing for the relatively easy and efficient export of natural resources and agricultural products to the port of Eden. In the US demand for passenger rail is also evident on certain corridors, exemplified by the proposed BrightLine routes between California and Nevada and the existing BrightLine route in Florida.

Overall, despite the lack of political will and lack of public support due to the heavy dependence on private vehicles, regional rail is a key piece of infrastructure in improving the cost and efficiency of regional travel as well as drastically decreasing the environmental impact of driving, or worse flying between major population and production areas within both Australia and the United States.

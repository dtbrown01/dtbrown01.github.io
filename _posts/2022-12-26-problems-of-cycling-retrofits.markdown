Cycling is a popular mode of transportation that offers numerous benefits for both individuals and communities. In order to make cycling a safe and viable option for everyone, it is essential to have a well-designed and well-maintained cycling infrastructure in place. Cities are finally realising the many benefits to cycling, with many rapidly attempting to expand and retrofit their (car centric) infrastructure, often will little to no planning in relation to cycling routes and safety. 

## What is Cycling Infrastructure?

Cycling infrastructure refers to the infrastructure that is specifically designed to support the use of bicycles as a mode of transportation. The most common forms of infrastructure can include bike lanes, bike racks and parking, as well as bike-sharing programs and designated cycling paths.

## How Could this be Bad?

Whilst a city spending any money on cycling infrastructure is often seen in positive light, and in itself is a rarity, poor infrastructure can often result in decreased safety. 

This decreased safety is largely a result of more cyclists, often of a lower skill level, utilising unsafe cycling infrastructure. This is largely a result of infrastructure which artificially inflates a cyclist's confidence, whilst not providing adequate safety precautions. Such infrastructure is normally associated with poor retrofits to existing roads, including painted bicycle lanes, and painted bicycle chevrons. These retrofits result in cyclists sharing the road with high speed cars, with a false sense of security given the mirage of bike friendly infrastructure. 

Other infrastructure includes dedicated cycling paths, often of a high quality, abruptly ending, forcing cyclists onto painted bicycle lanes which are usually placed on the side of busy roads with speed limits above 80 km/h.

## Solutions

Whilst improving cycling infrastructure is always largely a positive for cycling, there are several steps that can be taken to mitigate poor cycling retrofits, and update existing infrastructure. 

One of the most effective ways to improve existing infrastructure is to add physical barriers in place of painted bike lanes. These lanes being physically separated for motorised traffic is important to ensure safety, and also increase confidence of less experienced cyclists, allowing for cycling to be more viable for commutes. Further improving painted infrastructure, roads that have been specified as *"Bike Friendly* should have reduced speed limits for motorised traffic, with through traffic limited. This could be in the form of physical barriers in which cars can not pass (but bikes can) or even just local traffic (as long as it is policed).  

Other solutions are designed to increase the number of people utilising cycling as a means of transport, which is often overlooked during retrofits. These include bike racks which can support the locking of bikes. Other amenities which are not commonly considered include lockers and showers for commuters, which would be more necessary in locations with more extreme conditions.

Education and outreach is also important in order to educate the public about the benefits of cycling and the importance of safe cycling practices. This can be done through outreach programs, educational materials, and public awareness campaigns.

## What do you think of when you think of a street? 

Newly planted trees separated by concrete wastelands, with the occasional car parked in front of an oversized house. Or do you think of a road clogged with traffic, four or more lanes separating you from the narrow footpath on the opposite side. 

If you are from a car dependent suburb, these are what you would overwhelmingly experience, however it doesnâ€™t need to be like this. You can see this all throughout Europe, in historical centres where there are few cars and yet business is still booming.

Streets should be walkable with accessible and convenient alternatives to owning a car, not a death trap. Walkable streets combined with convenient and safe public transport have an enormous positive impact on a city. This can include an increase in economic activity, overall improved physical and mental health, improved environmental considerations and an increase in equity and safety. 

Walkable cities, with convenient transport options, can positively impact economics through increasing economic productivity, innovation and competitiveness. Walkable cities attract more customers and subsequently businesses, due to the increased number of people viewing shopfronts, as well as the greater capacity for people to access an area, when compared with the space requirements with cars. Pedestrians also spend 65% more than people in cars, improving the turnover of businesses within the area. More than 60% of pedestrians will also purchase from multiple stores within an area, improving the overall benefit for the retail sector, encouraging growth in smaller businesses, and limiting anti-competitive practices from larger companies. An increased usage of public transport can result in lower transportation costs for commuters, decreased spending on road infrastructure for municipalities, whilst also encouraging more active participation in the economy of a city. 

Walkable cities can improve public health by promoting physical activity, which can in turn reduce the prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases, whilst also improving mental well-being. Walkable areas encourage an increase in walking and,if properly designed, cycling, which both function as physical activity improving physical health, whilst also releasing endorphins, improving mental health. Cycling and walking are also significantly less polluting than other forms of transport, especially cars, increasing air quality and therefore significantly decreasing the prevalence of respiratory illnesses, resulting from pollution. A decrease in car traffic through cycling, walking and public transport, can also decrease the risk of fatalities and injury from collisions with cars, as well as decreasing noise present within a city. This decrease in noise can have a profound impact on long-term health as well as stress levels. 

The most important part of transforming streets to become more walkable is lowering speed limits and widening pedestrian paths, such as footpaths. Pedestrian focused streets should also give priority to pedestrian, allowing pedestrians to cross at more locations and overall improving the connectivity between each side of the street.

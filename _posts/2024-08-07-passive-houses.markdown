Passive houses are increasingly being constructed, with minimum requirements for standard construction constantly narrowing the gap and encouraging more people to absorb the higher short-term cost in order to reduce future energy usage, and subsequently reduce long-term costs.  With a recent move for all new houses to be constructed at EER 7 is voluntary passive house standard really that different?

A passive house is a building standard that emphasises energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainability. Originating in Germany as Passivhaus, the concept revolves around creating structures that require minimal energy for heating and cooling. This is achieved by superior insulation, airtightness, as well as strategic ventilation and aspect planning.

The key features of a passive house when compared to a standard house, and thus the higher initial construction cost, are more effective insulation, airtightness which requires more engineering in things like window frames and further emphasises the requirement for effective insulation. Glazing is also another significant aspect, with most passive houses having at least double or typically triple glazing. Other aspects also include heat recovery systems and optimisation of layout to optimise solar gain to the season and climate.

Even despite these significant construction costs, passive houses experience numerous long-term benefits. These benefits include a reduction in energy of up to 90% less than similar standard houses, as well as increased comfort. There is also the environmental impact with materials used for construction, and the significantly lower energy use, making passive houses far better for the environment.

Australia's unique and varied climate requires more unique planning for passive houses, but also maximises the benefits. The areas of particular challenge are the regions which experience both extreme winters and summers, as is evident in the south-east of Australia. Despite this, there has been a growing interest in passive houses which reflacts a broader trend towards sustainability in the Australian housing market. As awareness of environmental issues increases, more homeowners are seeking eco-friendly alternatives. The recent minimum energy efficiency standard changes has also raised more attention to passive house standards. As at EER 7 more care needs to be taken in the design and surrounding climate than previous standards.

In conclusion, passive houses represent a significant step towards sustainable living in Australia. By embracing these energy-efficient principles, Australians can enjoy comfortable, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible homes. As the movement gains momentum, the dream of widespread sustainable living becomes an attainable reality.

Modern transport projects seem to all have one thing in common, they are in straight lines and are close to many places, but not close enough to be convenient for any of them. There are many reasons for this, sometimes it is the most optimal route as it is between two places, sometimes its cost, other times its purely the ideal of a corridor. 

I have been thinking about this more in relation to the Light Rail in Canberra, and how it has much more potential to link destinations if it doesn’t purely follow the car corridors. Sure, some of these corridors are more convenient because they already have wide enough medians, and there is less need for interruptions, however some of the other routes have greater potential to be improved for pedestrians and cyclists as well as light-rail. The ACT Government’s focus on corridors is even more evident by the preference of stage 2B to go via state circuit rather than through Barton, despite going through Barton improving connections to accommodation and workplaces which is likely to increase rider-ship as opposed to being on car-focused corridors. 

The focus on car corridors is perfectly reasonable in areas where the corridor is between centre points, as easements and space already exist, and there are few stops, allowing for fast speeds. However, in inner city areas, like Northbourne Avenue, a central corridor whilst being simple minimises potential stops and ridership. The location of the Light-Rail in the centre median also negatively impacts its potential value, whilst still overall being beneficial, prime real estate adjacent to transport is occupied by a major road corridor, regardless of its low speed limit.

Theoretical future light rail expansions (with no cost considerations at all) that primarily follow corridors but vary to better reach destinations are shown in the above sketch. These follow corridors for the majority of the distance but in the urban areas deviate to the ANU, Canberra Centre, Convention Centre, AIS, and University of Canberra. Of course, these are theoretical and future network plans beyond light rail to Woden have not been released.

Overall, corridor fixation in public transport does result in less convenient public transport, but it ultimately isn’t that big of a deterrence and allows for more streamlined and cost-efficient development of public transport which is overall a benefit to a city. Despite this, for very little extra work networks can be built to deviate in smaller areas to allow for more accessible destinations or population centres which has a large impact on potential ridership.

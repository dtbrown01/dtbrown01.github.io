Cycling infrastructure has widely known, and far-reaching benefits, but it also has a few less known and even negative impacts. The development of dedicated cycling infrastructure brings significant benefits to cities, their residents, and their economies.  One of the clearest benefits of cycling is the improvement in public health. By encouraging active transportation and supplying safe cycling routes, cities promote physical activity and combat sedentary lifestyles. This leads to enhanced cardiovascular health, reduced risks of chronic diseases, and overall well-being. Additionally, cycling as a mode of transportation offers mental health benefits, such as stress reduction and improved mental clarity.

From an environmental perspective, investing in cycling infrastructure contributes to sustainability efforts. By prioritising cycling as a practical mode of transportation, cities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution associated with motorized vehicles. Promoting cycling helps decrease traffic congestion, leading to improved air quality and a healthier urban environment. The shift towards cycling also aligns with global climate change goals, as it reduces reliance on fossil fuels and supports the transition to cleaner, greener transportation options. 

However, it is important to acknowledge the negative hidden consequences as well. The implementation of cycling infrastructure often requires the reallocation of space, which can lead to a reduction in available parking spaces. This may be viewed unfavourably by motorists, particularly in areas where parking is already limited. Addressing this issue requires careful planning and communication to ensure a balance between the needs of different transportation modes and the concerns of motorists. 

Additionally, there is a risk of potential displacement of other modes of transportation. While prioritizing cycling is important, it should not come at the expense of neglecting public transit or pedestrian infrastructure. Striking a balance and ensuring a comprehensive and integrated transportation network is crucial to cater to the diverse needs of all residents. 

These negative consequences are key arguments of city governments aiming to prevent further cycling infrastructure, or in even more extreme cases, removing existing cycling infrastructure. This has been shown by the new local government in Berlin, which is sponsored by the German motor industry. The key promises were to increase the quality of life for drivers, by replacing cycling lanes with parking, and decreasing cyclists, as to limit the inconvenience to cyclists. This is both a representation of the different views and beliefs about what is best for our cities, as well as the power of political lobbying in a achieving corporationsâ€™ goals, not necessarily helping citizens.

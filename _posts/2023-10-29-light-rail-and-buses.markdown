The debate between light rail and buses has been long-lasting and a key political issue. Advocates for both have strong arguments, however it can be simplified to busses being better in the short-term, but light rail having a sizeable benefit in the long-term. Despite this clear distinction it is still difficult to determine what is the best suited for a community, and whether the initial cost for light rail is worthwhile, especially given the political objectives that undermine modern-day urban planning.

One of the primary factors that often comes into play when deciding between light rail and buses is the cost. Buses are typically more cost-effective to implement. They don't require the same infrastructure investment as light rail systems. Light rail lines necessitate dedicated tracks, overhead wires, and stations, which can incur high initial expenses. However, operating costs of buses can increase significantly with time, and there is a lesser operating cost for light rail vehicles when compared with buses, especially when capacity is incorporated. Operational costs of fuel is another major long-term cost with buses, which is negligible, in comparison, for light rails given their powering through electricity. 

Light rail systems generally have a higher passenger capacity compared to buses. This can be a significant advantage during peak hours or in densely populated areas. Light rail vehicles can often carry more passengers, offering a more comfortable ride and potentially reducing congestion on the roads.

Furthermore, light rail systems tend to have more consistent and predictable schedules, which can make them a more appealing option for commuters who rely on public transportation. However, this can also be a drawback, with busses having the capacity to adapt to conditions and demand with greater ease, especially during large events.

Both buses and light rails have a large environmental impact, fossil fuel powered buses have this impact throughout the duration of their operation, with electric buses and light rail systems having a large initial environmental impact, with minimal impact during operation, especially if the energy is provided from renewable sources. Buses, especially those running on diesel fuel, can also contribute to local environment concerns, such as air quality, however in comparison to cars this is minimal when accounting for capacity.

Light rail can play a crucial role in urban development. It can encourage higher-density development near stations, promoting walkability and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. The permanence of light rail lines often leads to more significant investment from businesses and developers, spurring economic growth in the surrounding areas. Buses do not have such a pronounced impact, and often are used to support, and excuse, urban sprawl a damaging form of zoning which leads to un-walkable and less liveable cities.

Both light rail and buses have made large strides at accessibility. Modern light rails have level boarding with the platform, and the large infrastructure requirement results in greater planning into stop accessibility. In contrast buses are slightly less accessible, often requiring at least a few steps on entry, although ramps or lifts are often fitted in newer vehicles. Buses can also better support those with accessibility constraints, due to both greater flexibility, and a wider range of routes.

The choice between light rail and buses ultimately depends on the unique needs and circumstances of a community. Both modes of transportation have their distinct advantages and drawbacks. Often though, a light rail system is of great benefit to the community in the long-term, providing both lower long-term operational costs and greater reliability, as well as promoting more human centric development and ultimately helping to counteract car dependency in most modern cities. Buses, will however, always be a key part of a transportation network, due to their greater route flexibility and ability to adapt to demand, such as large events and even the occasional network failures, or closures resulting from works, within rail (light rail included).
